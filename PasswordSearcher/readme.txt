This is a password searcher project I made (uses binary search).
Put all of the passwords you want to search for in "text_to_search.txt" (as a giant list of passwords with no spaces and separated by endline characters ("enter" or "\n").
It will return the position of the password, 1-indexed, representing its ranking on the most-used passwords list (see the Wikipedia article to get all of the passwords).
