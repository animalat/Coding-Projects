The original Card, Deck, and Hand classes were created by my CS teacher :D
I modified parts of these classes, then used them to create a whole new black jack game.

Note: I changed the following code twice for the images to work on my MacBook:
1. String filename = "images/" + suit + "-" + value + ".jpg";
2. String filename = "images/" + suit + "-" + value + ".jpg";
Using the following changes (specifically, changing "images//" into "images/"), the code works on my MacBook instead of crashing when loading images, however, if it does break, change the "images/" back into "images//" as it was originally.
